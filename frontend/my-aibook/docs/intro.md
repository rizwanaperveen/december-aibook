# Introduction to Embodied AI Systems

Welcome to the **Embodied AI Systems Book**, where you'll learn about building intelligent robotic systems that interact with the physical world.

## About This Book

This comprehensive guide covers two fundamental aspects of embodied AI:

- **Module 1**: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Learn about ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services, rclpy agent-to-ROS bridge, and URDF basics for humanoid robots
- **Module 2**: Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity) - Explore physics simulation, Unity rendering, HRI, and sensor simulation including LiDAR, Camera, and IMU

## Getting Started

This book is designed to take you from beginner to advanced concepts in embodied AI systems. Each module builds on the previous knowledge while providing hands-on examples and practical applications.

## What You'll Learn

- How to design and implement robotic control systems using ROS 2
- Techniques for creating digital twins with realistic physics simulation
- Integration patterns between AI agents and robotic systems
- Sensor fusion and perception for embodied systems
- Human-robot interaction principles and implementation

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python preferred)
- Understanding of linear algebra and basic physics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line (helpful but not required)

Let's begin your journey into the fascinating world of embodied AI systems!
