# Implementation Plan: Embodied AI Systems Book + RAG Chatbot

**Branch**: `main` | **Date**: 2025-12-12 | **Spec**: [link](../001-embodied-ai-book/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-embodied-ai-book/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a Docusaurus-based technical book with two modules (ROS 2 & Digital Twin), enhanced with an integrated RAG chatbot connected to a FastAPI backend, Qdrant vector DB, and Neon Postgres. The system provides grounded AI responses based on book content with proper citations and selected-text mode functionality.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12, TypeScript/JavaScript, Node.js 20+
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Docusaurus, Qdrant Client, React, Google Generative AI, @google/generative-ai
**Storage**: Qdrant Cloud (vector database), Neon Postgres (metadata), GitHub Pages (static hosting)
**Testing**: pytest, Jest, React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Web application (Linux server backend, cross-platform frontend)
**Project Type**: web - with separate frontend and backend components
**Performance Goals**: <2 seconds response time for RAG queries, 99.9% uptime for book and chatbot services
**Constraints**: <200ms p95 for API responses, secure API key handling, offline-capable documentation
**Scale/Scope**: Support 100 concurrent users, 10k+ book content chunks in vector database

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ Documentation-First Approach: Docusaurus-based book content with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Grounded AI Responses: RAG chatbot responses grounded in book content with citations
- ✅ Modular Architecture: Separate services for book (Docusaurus), backend (FastAPI), vector storage (Qdrant Cloud), and database (Neon Postgres)
- ✅ Performance and Reliability: Target <2s response time for semantic search
- ✅ Open Source and Accessibility: Deployed on GitHub Pages for public access

**Structure Decision**: Web application with separate backend and frontend components to enable modular architecture as required by the constitution. The backend handles RAG processing and API endpoints, while the frontend manages the book presentation and chat interface.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Multiple services | Required for modular architecture per constitution | Tight coupling would violate "Modular Architecture" principle |
| Vector database | Required for semantic search functionality | Keyword search would not provide adequate RAG capabilities |
